# webpack-basic-starter

A basic webpack starter kit.

this demo shows how webpack works with sass, es6, third-party library(jQuery, moment .etc), legacy javascript code(like jQuery plugin).

How is it work?
**install the deps**
we are testing library using npm(jquery, moment) and bower (lodash).
```bash
npm install && bower install
```

**run the dev server**
```bash
npm run start
```

then open your http://localhost:8080 see how the magic happens.

**deployment**

```bash
npm run build
```
then you'll find a new build folder generated.

**TODO: testing**

```bash
npm run test
```
